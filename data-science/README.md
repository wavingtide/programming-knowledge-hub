# Machine Learning

## Machine Learning Workflow
Machine learning requires experimenting with a wide range of the following to build a model that maximizes some target metrics.
- datasets
- data preparation steps
- algorithms

Once you build the model, you need to
- deploy it to a production system
- monitor its performance
- continuously retrain it on new data and compare with alternative model
